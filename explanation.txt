For the culminating project of TEJ4M Computer Engineering class, Raspberry Pis were ordered for applying the students' networking knowledge to real life scenarios. However, the built-in wireless chip does not support the SSIDs, namely "YRDSB-S", that use WPA/WPA2 Enterprise security protocol that the school board uses across the routers in the school. As a result, routers with compatible security protocols are used to create a network for the Pis to connect. In order for the Pis to download relevant packages and receive update for those packages, we request to use a connection from the school desktop Ethernet bus so that the Pis can have access to the internet. This would not violate any board policies as the router still has to obey the board firewall exceptions and all restrictions applied to any other device connected to the school network will be applied to the Pis as well.
